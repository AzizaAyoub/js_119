**What does the every method do?**  

The `every` method works similar to `some`. It take a callback as argument, and it also look at the truthiness of the callback returns value. If the callback returns truthy value for all of the elements `every` retruns `true`, otherwise `false`


`every` can also be used with object method to extract the `value` `keys` or `key-value-pairs`
