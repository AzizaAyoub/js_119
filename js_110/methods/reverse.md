**What does the `reverse` method do?**  


The reverse method reverses the elements of the array it's called on. Meaning the first element will become the last element and the last element will become the first element.

The reverse method mutate the original array. If we doesn't want to mutate original array we can use the slice method to make a copy of the array and then use the reverse method on this copyed array.
