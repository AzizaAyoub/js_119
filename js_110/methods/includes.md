**What does the `includes` method do?**   

The `includes` method searches the array it's called on for an element whose value is strictly equal to the singal argument, if so returns `true`, otherwise `false`.

except `NaN`, in all other cases, includes acts like it uses === to compare values.

Another method to check if a key exists in an object is `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty`.

**Summary**  
JavaScript arrays supply more than 30 methods, many of which you will find useful in your future programs. We recommend that you memorize the basic details of the methods we've discussed in this assignment and the previous assignment, and become familiar with what else is available. Nobody expects you to memorize every last detail of all these methods, but, the more familiar you are with them, the easier it will be to solve problems.
