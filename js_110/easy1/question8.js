// How can we add the family pet, "Dino", to the following array?

let flintstones = ["Fred", "Barney", "Wilma", "Betty", "Bambam", "Pebbles"];

flintstones.push('Dino');
console.log(flintstones);

/*
We can use the push method to append new elements to the end of the array. And also it will mutate our
original array.
